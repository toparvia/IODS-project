## Chapter 2.

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using  

I moved to the next set excercises DataCamp: Regression and model validation. The exercises were quite interesting and showed some things that I didn't know before.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p <-ggpairs(learning2014, mapping = aes(col = gender, alpha = 0.3), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))

# Data exploration of the learning2014 with ggpairs
```
I found this code quite useful for getting an overview of the data. I have previously used a more simple plotting tools for initial analysis such as correlation or histograms separately, but I might use this one again since it provides insight with only one figure.
